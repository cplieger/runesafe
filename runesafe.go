// SanitizeCapped is Sanitize followed by a byte cap that INCLUDES the

// sanitized form exceeds n bytes it cuts that form on a rune boundary at
// n-len(marker) bytes and appends marker, so the returned text is at most
// max(n, 0) bytes whatever marker is. A within-cap value comes back
// untouched — byte-identical to Sanitize, no marker.
//
// cut reports whether the sanitized form was SHORTENED, not whether
// sanitizing rewrote anything: it is true exactly when that form did not fit
// in n bytes, and false whenever the returned text is the whole sanitized
// form. It exists because a marker cannot prove a cut — a value may end in
// the marker on its own — so a caller that must report truncation as a fact
// (a log attribute beside the value, a decision to keep a fuller copy
// elsewhere) would otherwise re-implement this composition just to set its
// own flag.
//
// n bounds the TOTAL, which is what a caller with a real budget needs: a
// record persisted under a write limit, a payload assembled under a vendor
// byte cap, a fixed-width column. SanitizeSingleLineBounded puts its marker
// OUTSIDE the cap (a truncated result runs to n+3 bytes), which leaves such
// a caller subtracting the marker's width by hand at every call site.
//
// A marker longer than n cannot be shown intact, and a partial marker is
// indistinguishable from content, so for n < len(marker) the result is the
// rune-boundary prefix of the sanitized form alone — the empty string for a
// non-positive n — and the elision is reported through cut only. An empty
// marker is legal and yields a silent cap (CapBytes over the sanitized form)
// with the fact still returned. An empty s returns "" and false under any n,
// negative included. marker is emitted verbatim, never sanitized: it is the
// caller's own program text, and rewriting it would silently alter a chosen
// mark — a marker assembled from untrusted input must be sanitized by the
// caller first.
//
// The CR/LF policy is a second function rather than a parameter on this one,
// deliberately: the package already expresses that choice as the named
// Sanitize / SanitizeSingleLine pair, so a call site names its sink instead
// of passing an opaque boolean next to two other tuning arguments. The
// per-rune predicates follow the same rule since v2: IsUnsafeMultiLine and
// IsUnsafeSingleLine are named for their policy, and a composed policy takes
// whichever predicate is its data.
// SanitizeSingleLineCapped is the strict twin.
//
// Two consumer shapes this pair deliberately does NOT serve, and must not be
// widened to serve:
//
//   - Capping BEFORE sanitizing, to bound the sanitizer's WORK rather than
//     its output. A caller that must never walk a multi-megabyte upstream
//     value in a memory-limited process caps the raw bytes first (CapBytes,
//     then Sanitize on the chunk); this function sanitizes all of s by
//     construction, and no marker placement changes that. Such a caller also
//     tends to aggregate one truncation fact across several appends, which a
//     single-call primitive cannot express. Both shapes belong to
//     SanitizeBudgeted and Budget — a separate primitive carrying the cap
//     ahead of the sanitizer and a running remainder, sharing this pair's
//     rune-boundary cut, marker-inside-the-cap and cut-as-a-fact rules while
//     leaving the contract above exactly as it is.
//   - Keeping the TAIL behind a PREFIXED marker. When the identifying part of
//     a value sits at its end (a path's file name), the caller wants
//     marker + suffix; this function keeps the head. Compose the
//     rune-boundary walk locally for that.
func SanitizeCapped(s string, n int, marker string) (text string, cut bool) {
	// The rune-boundary cut, the marker charged inside the cap and the cut
	// FACT are the Budget engine's, so there is one copy of that arithmetic
	// rather than one per bound. Sanitizing FIRST is what keeps this pair's
	// OUTPUT bound, and with it the pair's side of the one divergence
	// documented on SanitizeBudgeted: the budget is spent on the sanitized
	// form, so a value whose RAW bytes exceed n while its sanitized form fits
	// still comes back whole and unmarked here. The budget's own pre-cap then
	// has nothing left to collapse, and its sanitizer pass is a no-op —

// form. It is the log-bound preset for VOLUME as well as rune safety: an
// upstream-controlled value headed for a log attribute (a query parameter, a
// JSON key name, an upstream error body) must not balloon a record past
// downstream log-pipeline limits, and every consumer hand-rolled exactly this
// sanitize-cap-mark composition. The cap applies to the SANITIZED form
// (sanitizing can grow invalid bytes into the three-byte U+FFFD, so a
// pre-sanitize cap does not survive), and the marker sits outside the cap: a
// truncated result is at most n+3 bytes and always ends in the marker. The
// converse does not hold — a within-cap input may itself end in "..." — so
// the marker marks the cut without proving one; a caller that must know
// whether truncation occurred, supply its own marker, or hold the total
// (marker included) under a hard budget uses SanitizeSingleLineCapped, which
// returns the fact and counts the marker inside the cap. A non-positive n
