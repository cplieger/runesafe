// Budget is a byte budget several untrusted values are sanitized under,
// together, retaining ONE truncation fact for the whole aggregate. Each value
// is capped on a rune boundary BEFORE the sanitizer walks it, so the budget
// bounds the sanitizer's WORK and not merely its output, and the marker is
// charged inside the budget exactly as SanitizeCapped charges it.
//
// It is a SEPARATE primitive from the Capped pair rather than an option on it,
// and the reason is in that pair's own contract: SanitizeCapped sanitizes all
// of s by construction, because its cap must survive sanitization growth for a
// value already known to be small, and no marker placement changes that. A
// caller whose value is NOT known to be small needs the opposite order, and a
// caller assembling SEVERAL values under one shared bound needs a running
// remainder and a latched fact that a single-call function cannot express.
// Widening the pair to reach either shape would have made a two-argument
// function a four-argument one and put a work bound and an output bound behind
// the same name; the pair therefore stays as it is (see SanitizeCapped, which
// names both shapes as ones it must not be widened to serve), and this type
// owns them. What the two share — the rune-boundary cut, the marker charged
// inside the cap, the cut FACT returned rather than inferred from the marker —
// is identical on purpose, so a call site can move between them without
// re-reading either contract.
//
// The order is the whole point of the type. A multi-megabyte upstream value
// walked by strings.Map in a memory-limited process is a work-amplification
// denial of service (CWE-400) whatever the output bound is, so a caller reading
// an upstream field whose size it does not control caps first. For a value that
// carries no unsafe rune and is valid UTF-8 the two orders are byte-identical,
// so adopting this one changes nothing an honest value emits; the two diverge
// for exactly one input class, described on SanitizeBudgeted.
//
// A Budget is a running remainder over values that ACCUMULATE. A caller
// bounding several separate output fields by re-measuring an envelope after
// each trim (a marshaled payload against a vendor limit) is not that shape and
// keeps its own loop over the Capped pair.
//
// Use NewBudget or NewSingleLineBudget; the zero value has no budget and would
// treat every write as a cut. A Budget must not be copied after its first
// write, and it is not safe for concurrent use.

//
// n bounds the TOTAL the aggregate can ever reach, marker included: whatever
// the writes do, Result returns at most max(n, 0) bytes. A non-positive n
// therefore accepts nothing, and reports a cut for the first non-empty write.
//

// still returned by Result.

// budget, marker and cut contract are identical to NewBudget's; the CR/LF
// policy is a second constructor rather than a parameter for the same reason
// SanitizeSingleLineCapped is a second function, so a call site names its sink
// instead of passing an opaque boolean.

// Write appends the sanitized prefix of raw that still fits the remaining
// budget and reports whether the aggregate is still WHOLE — that is, whether
// nothing has been dropped yet. It caps raw on a rune boundary at the remaining
// budget FIRST, so the sanitizer never walks more bytes than the budget allows
// however long raw is; sanitizing can then grow the chunk (each invalid UTF-8
// byte becomes the three-byte U+FFFD), so the result is re-capped on a rune
// boundary. Either cut latches the fact Result reports.
//
// Once anything has been cut, or the budget is spent, further writes append
// nothing: a non-empty one is refused whole rather than partially, because an
// aggregate that mixed a truncated value with a later whole one would read as
// if the two were contiguous. A write of "" never sets the fact.
//
// The return value is the loop condition an aggregating caller wants, and it is
// deliberately NOT "the budget has room left": a caller must ATTEMPT the write
// it cannot fit, because the refusal is what latches the truncation fact.
// Stopping on a spent-but-uncut budget instead would drop the remaining values
// silently, and Result would call the aggregate whole.
//
// A fixed separator between values goes through Write too, so a hostile piece
// COUNT cannot grow the aggregate past the budget either. Sanitizing an ASCII
// separator is a no-op, so an aggregate of honest values is byte-identical to
// the joined-then-capped form.
//
// Write is deliberately not io.Writer: a sink that drops bytes on purpose
// cannot honour that interface's "wrote all of p, or returned an error"
// contract, and reporting a short write as an error would make every ordinary
// truncation look like a failure.

// anything, and it is the fact a caller reports beside the value (a
// "…_truncated" log attribute, a decision to keep a fuller copy elsewhere). A
// marker cannot stand in for it: a value may end in the marker on its own.
//
// A budget too small to hold the marker intact drops the marker rather than
// emitting a fragment of it, and reports the elision through cut alone.

// SanitizeBudgeted is the one-value form of NewBudget: a Budget of n bytes, one
// Write of s, and its Result. It is SanitizeCapped with the cap moved AHEAD of
// the sanitizer — s is capped on a rune boundary at n bytes first, the chunk is
// sanitized under the keepCRLF=true policy, sanitization growth is re-capped,
// and the caller's marker is charged inside n — so the budget bounds the WORK
// done on s rather than only the size of what comes back. Reach for it when s
// comes from an upstream whose size the caller does not control (a response
// field, an error message interpolating one, a file name), where walking all of
// it is itself the exposure; reach for SanitizeCapped when s is already known
// to be small and only its output needs bounding.
//
// The two orders agree on every valid-UTF-8 value that carries no unsafe rune,
// byte for byte, cut for cut, so a call site can move to this one without
// changing what an honest value emits. They diverge for exactly one input
// class: a value whose RAW form exceeds n but whose SANITIZED form would have
// fitted, which needs enough multi-byte unsafe runes to collapse it under the
// cap (each becomes a single-byte space) — the hostile shape the work bound
// exists for. This function cuts and marks such a value where SanitizeCapped
// returns it whole and unmarked, and the mark is honest either way: bytes
// really were dropped, before sanitizing.
