// Budget and the Budgeted pair are sold entirely on a COST property: for a value
// carrying no unsafe rune they are byte-identical to the Capped pair, cut for cut, but
// the cap sits AHEAD of the sanitizer, so walking a multi-megabyte upstream value
// inside a memory-limited process (CWE-400 work amplification) stops being possible.
// The two bounds gated here are that the budgeted order's cost does not grow with the
// raw value's size, and that once the allowance is spent a further write costs nothing
// at all — which is what stops a hostile piece COUNT amplifying the aggregate.
//
// One thing the doc comments do not claim, and a reader could assume the other way
// round: for a handful of small HONEST values the streaming Budget is the DEARER shape
// (8 values of 16 bytes under a 200-byte budget cost 7 allocations and 544 bytes
// streaming against 2 and 304 joined). The shapes cross over as values grow — by
// 64 KiB each it is 1.5 us against 2.5 ms. The Budget is a bound on the hostile case,
// not an optimization for the honest one, and BenchmarkAggregate shows both halves.

// benchGroups is the aggregate fixture: several upstream-controlled values headed for
// ONE log attribute under ONE shared byte budget. Two carry unsafe runes and one of
// those is FIRST, so the measured path includes a rewrite; with a clean value leading,
// the whole first write is absorbed by the sanitizer's fast path and the series would
// describe the wrong work.

// them, so its cost is a function of the CAP and not of the value an upstream chose to

//
// The assertion is on allocated BYTES, because that is what the claim is about and the
// allocation count barely moves — see allocBytesPerRun. With a 64-byte cap over
// invalid UTF-8 the budgeted order allocates 368 bytes per call at every raw size from
// 1 KiB to 1 MiB, while the capped order runs about 3.1 KB, 98 KB, then 4.0 MB.
// Deleting the pre-cap puts the budgeted order on the capped order's numbers, which is
// how this assertion was seen to fail.
//
// The tolerance is a factor of two across a 1024x increase in input, not equality:
// TotalAlloc picks up whatever else the runtime did during the loop. The count is
// checked for constancy too, but as the weaker of the two.
